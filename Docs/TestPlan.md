- Check key is cached

2. Cache Tests
- Force quit app
- Relaunch
- Verify cached key is used
- Clear cache
- Verify new fetch occurs

3. Concurrent Access Tests
- Clear cache
- Rapidly tap multiple API-using features
- Verify app handles concurrent requests gracefully

4. Error Cases
- Enable airplane mode

- Verify cached keys still work
